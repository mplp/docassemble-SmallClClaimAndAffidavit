question: |
  Small Claims Rules
subquestion: |
  There are some special rules in Small Claims Court. Carefully read the list below so that you can make sure this process is right for you. In small claims:
   
  1. **Neither side can have a lawyer.** This includes not being allowed to get help from a lawyer if you win the case and you need to collect the judgment.
  1. **You can only ask for money.** If you want to ask for something of yours to be returned -- like your car or your dog -- you might be able to use a claim and delivery case. You can [search for a lawyer](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/resources/going-court/limited-scope-representation-lsr-more-affordable-way-hire-lawyer) or use the [Claim and Delivery](https://www.courts.michigan.gov/4a6ed0/siteassets/forms/scao-approved/mc35.pdf) court form. 
  1. **You can only ask for up to $7,000.** If the other person owes more than $7,000, you can still use small claims, but the court can only order up to $7,000 in the judgment. If you want to ask for more, you can search for a lawyer to help you or use the [SCAO forms page](https://www.courts.michigan.gov/SCAO-forms/) to find out if there is a form for your kind of case.
  1. **You can't appeal decisions** in Small Claims Court unless the court has a magistrate on the case. If a magistrate makes the decision in your case, you are allowed to make a very limited appeal to a Small Claims judge.
  1. **You can't have a jury trial.**

template: directly_involved_transaction_explanation
subject: |
  What does this mean?
content: |
  To sue in small claims court, you have to be **directly** involved in what happened.
    
  **Example: car repair**<br>
  For example, if you are suing over an agreement **you** had with someone to repair a car, **you are directly** involved in the dispute. 
 
  Sometimes people can be involved in a dispute, but not **directly** involved. For example, even if the agreement to repair the car was for your daughter's car, your daughter is **not directly involved**. This is because she didn't make the agreement, and she didn't pay the money. Since you made the agreement, you can sue, but your daughter can't.

  **Example: debt collection**<br>
  This can also come up in debt collection. Sometimes a creditor, like a credit card company or hospital, hires a collection agency to collect the debt for them. The collection agency can't use small claims because they were not part of whatever happened that made the debt --- like the credit card agreement.
